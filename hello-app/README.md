# Overview

Thank you for your interest in CoinTracker! üéâ

We'd like you to work on this assignment to get a sense of your technical skills in designing and building a system that closely resembles the type of work we do day-to-day at CoinTracker.

Please submit your output within **24 hours** of starting the assignment.

We suggest reading through this doc, taking some time to think, setup your local environment for development, and budgeting ~**2 - 4 hours** for completing the assignment.

# The assignment

## Goal

Deploy a working Hello World application using [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code). 

<aside>
üí° Focus on aspects that will showcase your skills and optimize for a working product at the end of the time.

</aside>

## Requirements

- Build a releasable artifact that can respond to an HTTP request with ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù. The exact format is up to you and could be something like a Docker image, JAR/WAR file, Python/Bash scripts, or whatever you feel is appropriate.
- Creation of the hosting infrastructure and release process are scripted or codified.

## Potential Project Components

Pick the component(s) you plan to build to demonstrate your skill and abilities. Prioritize a working demo. You **do not** need (and likely **should** **not** attempt) to include all components in your demo.

Some ideas: 

- Automated release process for the Hello World artifact
- Mutil-zone or multi-region deployment

### Questions?

To avoid getting blocked, use your best judgment and state your assumptions.

## Part 1: Figure out what you‚Äôre going to do (~30 minutes)

<aside>
üí° **Notion:** Knowledge base where you'll fill out the written sections of the assignment. We have sent you a blank Notion page you can use to capture your responses. You may need to create a free Notion account if you don't already have one to edit the page. Feel free to hand-draw and include images as well.

</aside>

1. **Scope out the work to be completed:**
    
    For example:
    
    1. What format / tooling will be used to package the artifact
    2. What will the Internet ‚Üí app request flow look like and what services are required. 
2. **Define high-level components:** Define the high-level components of the system. The design does not have to be exhaustive - design around your strengths, whether database, automation, monitoring. Feel free to include a short description on why you made the decisions you did.

## Part 2: Build it (~90 minutes)

- **Development environment:** Use the programming languages and frameworks that you are most comfortable with. **Make sure your development environment is reproducible by CoinTracker engineers.**
- **Source control:** Use GitHub as the source control for your code.

# Deliverables

Share the following deliverables with the team in the Notion doc, or via email:

1. **Source code:** Share the link to your project source code on GitHub.  For private projects, add GitHub user `ct-hiring` as a collaborator ([https://github.com/ct-hiring](https://github.com/ct-hiring)).
2. **README:** Your `README` file should make it clear how to setup the development environment and run your code. 
    1. Include information about the assumptions made while building the project
    2. Highlight interesting architecture decisions

### Need more time?

Please don‚Äôt spend more than 4 hours total working on the exercise. If you need extra time, please let us know as soon as possible.

### What are the next steps?

Please shoot us an email to your Notion page and a link to your GitHub repository when you're finished, and we'll get back to you within a few business days.

## What we're looking for

- Your ability to develop a working proof of concept (albeit a v0.1). In particular, we look for clean, well-designed, tested, and maintainable code.
- Your ability to communicate technical and product ideas, handle some autonomy and ambiguity, and the overall quality of your work.
